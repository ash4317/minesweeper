# Minesweeper

My attempt on the traditional Minesweeper game using "Pygame" package in Python.<br><br>

Clone this repo wherever you want on your device. Make sure python is installed on your device.<br>
Open command prompt (for Windows users), terminal (for Linux users) or shell (for iOS users) and enter this directory.<br><br>

Then run the file "game.py" as follows -<br>
```
python3 game.py 20
```
OR
```
python game.py 20
```
whichever you want.
<br>
This will create a 20 x 20 square grid for your minesweeper game. You can choose any grid size you want. Please don't use a very large grid size as the computation time will make the game very slow :P.<br>

Other than that, enjoy the game and the algos I have used to create this game! :)<br><br>

P.S. Feel free to suggest any alternate algorithm or strategy or a new feature to improve the efficiency and overall experience!
